# Tiny URL Service

## Description

This is a weekend project created to test my development skills, also it serves to let me learn how does the actual tinyURL work.  The API has 2 parts:

1. Tiny URL Creation
2. Ability to track access counts to the created TinyURL

## Next Steps

1. Modify response on ‘getAccessMetrics‘ to a better format for graphing the data. [✅]

   a. Metrics aggregated in time intervals.

3. Add capability for retrieving metrics between a specific timeframe or after/before a specific time/date. [✅]
4. Add user authentication [✅]
5. Refactor to use custom Responses/Requests and use ResponseEntity instead of ApiResponse
6. Add a basic frontend UI for creating the tinyURL.
7. Add basic frontend for User creation to track your created tinyURLs.
8. Add metrics dashboard for seeing performance of your created tinyURLs.
